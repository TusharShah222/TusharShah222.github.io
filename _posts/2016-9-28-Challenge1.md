### Challenge1:  MTA Data Turnstile

Your challenge problems (your discoveries, or your thoughts):

    This is the first time blogging it was a nice experience and hope to continue to do this for the rest of the class.  
    It allows me to gather my thoughts and reflect in weeks to come what I found challenging and what I now find easy.


Your Project Benson (the proposal/experience):

    Project Benson was a bit challenging.  We downloaded the MTA turnstyle data for a few months.  We cleaned it up to make the data much more usuable and easier to put into Panda DataFrames.  I learned that Panda DataFrames are extremelly helpful, when trying to manipulate massive amount of data.  Through all the data splicing we were able to get the daily foot traffic from each MTA Station on a given day.  Some of the observations we made we 34thSt Herald SQ, 42nd St time Sq. 42nd Street Port Authority, 34th St Penn Station and 14th St, were some of the stations with the highest foot traffic.  We also overlaid income data from the Census bureau to determine which areas have a high propensity to donate for the cause.  After our priliminary round of dispersing the Team to collect donations we can restrategize our deployment schedule based on new data.


General bootcamp thoughts:

        This bootcamp is extremelly challenging and at the same time extremelly fun. All the instructors as well as the TA, and staff are awesome.  They are always here and helpful. I do feel a bit overwhelmed, but this is a bootcamp.
